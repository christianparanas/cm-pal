					<div>Chocolate Hills Bohol, Philippines</div>
					<div class="dis">There are more than 1,000 symmetrical mounds, conical and dome-shaped that most people liken them to Hershey’s Kisses. It is called the Chocolate Hills not because it’s made of chocolate but because of its color. In the rainy season, the grass blanketing the hills gives them a soft and lush appearance. While in the summer, the vegetation dies off and turns to a chocolatey brown hue, giving them their name.</div>

					<div>Prague Old Town</div>
					<div class="dis">The medieval Old Town of the Czech Republic capital is bristling with historical sights, which is what makes it such a popular destination. At its heart is the Old Town Square, where you’ll find the Old Town Hall, boasting the Orloj – or Astronomical Clock – which dates back to 1410, making it the oldest clock still in operation in the world.</div>

					<div>Canals of Amsterdam</div>
					<div class="dis">Amsterdam is well known for its canals.

The waterways lead to Amsterdam being labeled the ‘Venice of the North.’</div>

					<div>Eiffel Tower</div>
					<div class="dis">Named after Gustave Eiffel, the unmistakable symbol of Paris is a sight that must be witnessed when visiting the French capital. Constructed between 1887 and 1889, the tower was originally built to be the impressive entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair. The tower stands at 324 meters tall and was amazingly the world’s tallest man-made structure until the Empire State Building took the title in 1930.</div>

					<div>Venice Beach in Los Angeles</div>
					<div class="dis">No visit to Los Angeles is complete without a trip to Venice Beach. Its canals and beaches are spectacular, but the biggest hit is undeniably the Venice Beach Boardwalk. This is a truly entertaining spot where street performers juggle, dance, sculpt and sing for passersby.</div>
